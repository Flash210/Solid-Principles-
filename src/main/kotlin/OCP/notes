// 2 OPC :Open for extension and closed for modification

 >>  principle is a software design principle that states software entities should be open for extension,
  but closed for modification. The idea is that once a module has been developed,
   the code should only be changed to correct bugs or to add new features. In other words,
   the behavior of a module can be extended, but not modified.
